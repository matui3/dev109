            What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?
            <ul>
                <li>My previous knowledge was all over the place. I've used a lot of JavaScript, but it had been some
                    time. I didn't like HTML or CSS. I already understood HTML, but with CSS, there were a lot of
                    fundamentals about positioning and other aspects that I was missing from self-teaching.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?
            <ul>
                <li>I used a template provided, but I did all the CSS myself. I took inspiration from looking at other
                    midterms and used ChatGPT to help me out. In general, I used a lot of AI, websites, and other
                    resources to help me understand how to make certain things work.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (i.e., the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?
            <ul>
                <li>I think the most challenging part was getting the audio to work across every page. I also found it
                    difficult to make the overall layout look nice (CSS). There was a card or section inside the overall
                    layout that I really wanted to make work.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            How did this class change your view on Web Development?
            <ul>
                <li>This class made web development a lot more enjoyable. Before, I didn't like it at all; I thought it
                    was boring. But learning more CSS and getting more practice improved things. I think having a better
                    understanding of the structure of a site really benefited what I feel can be done.</li>
            </ul>

            What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
            <ul>
                <li>I recommend future students explore! Go above and beyond the assignments to learn as much as you
                    can. Learn extra things about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript that challenge you, because you have a
                    project that can help with that.</li>
            </ul>
